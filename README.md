[Game Description:]
	  In this one-level snippet of the game, we continue the “Boo the Ghost” saga. Rather than being in space though dodging ginormous pumpkins, we are now in a parkour game 
  where the player has to collect all of the pumpkin coins.
  	In order to win, the player must collect all the coins within the time limit. If they succeed, the game will display a “You Win” message and restart the level. If the 
  player is unsuccessful in collecting all the coins within the one minute time limit, a “You Lose” message will appear and the level will restart.
	  I think the challenge of collecting all the coins before the timer runs out is the most engaging part of the game, since it's a challenge with the stakes being:
    "Lose all your progress".

[Technical Implementation:]
-Describe each game object and its behavior
-Explain how you implemented each technical requirement
-Include specific examples from your game
1. Levels - This game consists of one level with the objective being: Collect all the coins within the time limit. I think it is made clear with the countdown
     and coin collected counter.
2. Sprites - There are various sprites used in this game (each in their respective folders), such as the player, the coins, the boxes, the walls, and the platforms. The
    player sprite is actually controlled by the user using the above controls. Meanwhile the coins and boxes are what the player interact with, either to help get onto higher
   platforms or to increase the score. On the other hand, the walls and platform are just act as barriers.
